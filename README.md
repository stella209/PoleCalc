# PoleCalc
Polaris calculator to adjustment of equatorial mounts for amateur astronomer
Android apk for mobil phones.

Welcome to my first Android mobile app designed to help amateur astronomers set up a quick pole.
Shows the position of the Polar Star relative to the Pole at the current time.
GPS (Location) must be enabled on the mobile phone because the calculations are based on GPS data.
The 3 buttons at the bottom of the picture show:
EYES: In this situation we see with the naked eye;
KEPLER: Reverse pole finder in binoculars resp.
KEPLER + PRISMA: Kepler binoculars with prism.
Based on the JD2000 ephemeris, I corrected the position of the Polar Star with its own motion. Precession and abberation are not included, but they are so small that they are negligible.
